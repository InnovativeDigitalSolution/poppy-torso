# Poppy Torso
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/poppy-torso.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poppy-torso/)

Poppy Torso is an open-source and 3D printed humanoid robot powered by Python 3 and Snap programming languages. Optimized for research and education purposes, its modularity allows for a wide range of applications and experimentations.

Poppy Torso is actually the upper body of [Poppy Humanoid](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid) with a specific part so it can be easily fixed on a table.

## Build your own Poppy Torso
![](/doc/img/poppy_torso_3D.png)

You can buy a complete kit on the [Génération  Robots website](http://www.generationrobots.com/en/281-robot-poppy-torso) for 5300€.

You can also buy all components needed by your own. The full BOM is available here >> [Bill Of Material](https://docs.poppy-project.org/en/assembly-guides/poppy-torso/bom.html).

**The STL files are available in [the releases](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-torso/releases) of this repository.**

Then the process to assemble a complete Poppy Torso takes about a day. The assembly process is fully documented with video tutorials.

**For more informations, refer to the [assembly instructions](http://docs.poppy-project.org/en/assembly-guides/poppy-torso/index.html)**.

### Install poppy-torso
#### Install a Poppy board
Poppy Humanoid is shipped with a Raspberry Pi. Older Odroid versions are available in the releases.
In order to install the board byb yourself,**refer to the [poppy documentation](http://docs.poppy-project.org/en/installation/install-a-poppy-board.html)**.


#### Install on your personnal computer
If you want to install the software locally and not use the embedded board to control the robot or if you are working with the simulator, you will have to install Python. Install [poppy-torso](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-torso/tree/master/software): simply type `pip install poppy-torso`. 

**For more informations, refer to the [poppy documentation](http://docs.poppy-project.org/en/installation/index.html)**.

## The Poppy project history

The Poppy project is born in 2012 in the [Flowers laboratory](https://flowers.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux).
It was initiated during [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre)'s PhD Thesis surpervised by [Pierre Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). At the beginning, the development team was composed by [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre) (mechanics & design), [Pierre Rouanet](https://github.com/pierre-rouanet) (software) and [Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com/) (electronics).

This project is initially a fundamental research project financed by [ERC Grant Explorer](http://erc.europa.eu/) to explore the role of embodiement and morphology properties on cognition and especially on the learning of sensori-motor tasks. It is now hosted by the [Poppy Station non-profit](https://www.poppy-station.org/en).
